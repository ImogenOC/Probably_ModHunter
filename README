Features:
Single Target / AoE (Multi-Shot with hotkey support for barrage)
Several missing abilities from the included rotations were added
Some clean-up of the priority order and conditions from the included rotations
Engineering gloves usage is part of the rotation
Virmen's bite potion support
Stampede & AMoC is only cast when cooldowns is enabled plus the target is a boss mob
The rotation is more conservative when casting Arcane Shot to avoid focus starvation
Fervor is only cast when focus is below 50 instead of on cooldown
Interrupt should attempt scatter shot when Counter Shot is on CD
Several of the concepts and routines from rootWind were incorporated into these rotations


Hotkeys:
Left Alt - Barrage
Left Control - Binding Shot
Right Shift - Snake Trap
Right Alt - Explosive Trap
Right Control - Freezing Trap

Survival:
Deterrence was removed so that it can be cast manually when needed instead of always when health is below 40%
Exhilaration when health below 50%
Healthstone when below 40% health

Main Rotation:
Basically following the Icy Veins suggested priority system

To Do:
Implement some sort of 'smart AOE' system
Figure out how to share common blocks of code between the specializations so as to not duplicate code
More cleanup and optimization and other fancy tricks
